      <h2>What is a Hackathon?</h2>
      <p>
        A hackathon is a coding contest where participants create a coding project quickly given a time restriction. The name comes from the word "hack" which originally meant writing code quickly without worrying about how elegant it is.

        <a href="images/example.png"><img width="90%" src="images/example.png" alt="Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt. Write a program to open the file romeo.txt
          and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split function. For each
          word, check to see if the word is already in a list. If the word is not in the list, add it to the list. When
          the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.
          Enter file: romeo.txt
