      <h2>What is a Hackathon?</h2>
      <p>
        A hackathon is a coding event where you "hack" something together quickly given a time restriction. If you've heard of game jams, a hackathon is essentially the same thing, except you aren't restricted to only making games (though you can make a game if you'd like to). Hackathons often have a theme to guide participants, and our theme is Shakespeare.
